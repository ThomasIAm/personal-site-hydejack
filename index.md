## Blog

My first blog post hasn't been written yet, but I will at some point. Some time ago, I felt the urge to have a place where I could blog about something. There's definitely something in the works, but it needs some more time.

## Projects

Who doesn't like showing off the things they've made? On my projects page, I've selected a few of the things I made over the years. All of them have working demos, so definitely check them out!

## Wiki

This personal wiki is somewhat of an experimental ground for me. At some point, I wanted it to be a complete brain dump, blog, and community combined. You can find some knowledge from my study there, but that's it. Be sure to check it out though, because it's built on the amazing platform [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki/).
